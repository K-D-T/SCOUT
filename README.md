# SCOUT
This is an Android Application Written in Spring, MySQL, Java, and developed in Android Studio

Designed to allow collaboration between professionals who may not have the skillset required to complete their project; SCOUT fills a void that may not necessarily filled given the current environment. 

Our app's features include; user-2-user chats, the able to post jobs, the ability to show interest for candidates, favorite jobs, and more.

An Android app, SCOUT is developed in JAVA, mySQL, Android Studio, Spring, and WEBSOCKETS. Built from the ground up(excuse the Spring), our team believed we had found a solution to a prominent problem.
